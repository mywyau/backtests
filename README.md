# Backtests

Project was to test a backtesting library/tool 

Makes api calls out to polygon.io for stock data, then runs some algorithms and code to generate a backtest of a trading strategy based on Expoential moving average time series trend lines. Kinda okay likely not realistic but interesting.

Trading strategy is to trade in tiny frations and only buy and almost never sell. Presumption is SPY always goes up due to current financial system, crashes happen but stonks always goes up.
